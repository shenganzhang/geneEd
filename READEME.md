# GeneEd
 This application provides a platform for users to learn about the genetics of diseases, as well as genetics of common appearance traits. Users can search for genes that are associated with disease names and phenotype descriptions as well as DNA or protein sequences. It makes the world of genetics easy to explore for younger students or curious adults and would be of great use to high school science classrooms.
